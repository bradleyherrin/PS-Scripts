#Delete Disabled User Profiles
I work at a small hospital. Shared computers (ones at the nursing station for example), have a habit of filling up the hard drive. I created this script to get some of that space back.

##DisabledUsers.csv
At this small hospital, for auditing reasons, we keep all users that we disable for at least 1 year. At the time of disabling their account, they get moved to an OU called Disabled Users. I exported this list of users to a CSV and named it disabledusers.csv. The file supplied here contains a bunch of dummy users.
